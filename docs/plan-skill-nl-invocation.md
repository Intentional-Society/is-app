## Status at a glance

| Phase | Scope | State |
|---|---|---|
| **PR1** (#353) | NL invocation for `/commit`+`/pr`: drop `disable-model-invocation`, **Step 0** intent gate, single‑use **delegation marker**, v1.1 docs sweep, 4 NL‑routing evals | ✅ **Merged** |
| **PR2** (#353 fast‑follow) | Harness **merge gate** (checked‑in `.claude/settings.json` `ask` on `gh pr merge`), `/ship` Y/n deletion (Thread‑14 proof), `strategy-security` line | ✅ **Merged** |
| **PR3** (this branch `skill-nl-announce-affirmation`) | **`Using /commit`/`/pr` announcement** + **affirmation routing** + over‑trigger scope + **delegation‑announce**; announcement reliability relocation; semantic over‑trigger evals | 🚧 **In flight** |

**Tracking:** #353 (`Closes`‑ed by PR1+PR2). **PR3 is a follow‑on** — no issue filed; motivated by the
#459 commit incident. **Branch commits:** `ba9dc59` (announcement + affirmation routing + initial
evals/docs), `48d497c` (over‑trigger scope + `commit-7` + README→disposable‑fixture refactor +
pick‑up guide). The cold verification (below) added Finding 1 + Finding 2, resolved in the
in‑progress follow‑up.

## Shared mechanism facts (apply to every phase — don't re‑litigate without re‑checking the docs)

1. **Explicit slash invocation does not go through the `Skill` tool** — content is injected directly;
   model‑initiated (NL) invocation, **including a parent delegating to a child**, uses the `Skill`
   tool. The slash path also surfaces a `<command-name>` tag (a real slash signal), but treat
   source‑detection as a heuristic and **bias toward firing Step 0 when ambiguous**, leaning on the
   deterministic signals (delegation marker, opt‑out file). *(This fact is load‑bearing for PR3's
   announcement placement — see PR3 Design.)*
2. **Permission rules evaluate deny → ask → allow across ALL settings scopes and modes** (incl.
   `bypassPermissions`). A checked‑in `ask` rule can't be weakened locally — why PR2's `gh pr merge`
   `ask` is an un‑weakenable merge guard *in default mode* (caveat: `auto` mode auto‑approves, and a
   prior "don't ask again" silences it for the session — see Decision log, Thread 15).
3. **Removing `disable-model-invocation` puts the Skill's `description` into every session's context**
   — a permanent token cost and the NL‑matching surface. *(PR3 uses the description as the
   announcement's primary home — see PR3 Design.)*
4. `.gitignore` already ignores `.claude/*` (re‑including `.claude/skills/`), so the opt‑out marker
   needs no `.gitignore` change. Precedent: `/pr`'s `.team-cache.json`.

## Design (two‑tier, all phases)

| Tier | Skills | NL‑invocable | Gate | Enforcement |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Lower risk | `/commit`, `/pr` | Yes | Step‑0 intent prompt; local opt‑out file | Model‑level (in‑Skill) |
| Higher risk | `/ship` | No — explicit `/ship` only | Harness permission prompt on the merge command | Harness‑level (flag + ask‑rule) |

**Problem this solves:** contributors who don't know the Skills exist express commit/PR/ship intent
in natural language, and agents approximate the workflow instead of routing through the official
Skills — bypassing the team guardrails. Intent confirmation is useful by default; experienced
contributors opt out; `/ship` is held to a stricter, harness‑enforced standard.

# 🚧 PR3 — Announcement + affirmation routing (in flight)

> The current work, on branch `skill-nl-announce-affirmation`. Everything below the "Landed" divider
> is the merged #353 record, kept for rationale.

## Pick‑up guide (resume cold)

**What PR3 is.** Two NL‑path gaps surfaced in use (the second on the **#459** commit):
- **(a) routing** — when the *assistant* offers to commit/PR and the human replies a bare
  "yes"/"go ahead", the model could read it as approval of its *own* ad‑hoc plan and run `git`/`gh`
  directly instead of routing through the Skill (the trigger phrase came from the assistant, so the
  affirmation got disconnected from it).
- **(b) observability** — even when the Skill fired, nothing visibly said so (Step 0's confirmation
  is suppressed by opt‑out / delegation / slash), so you couldn't tell the Skill ran vs. a
  hand‑rolled commit.

**Fix (model‑level, no harness change):** a bare affirmation of the assistant's *own* commit/PR offer
is a trigger that routes through the Skill (scoped so it doesn't over‑trigger on unrelated offers),
and every model‑invoked `/commit`/`/pr` run announces `Using /commit`/`Using /pr` as its first line —
including down the `/ship` → `/pr` → `/commit` delegation chain.

**Change surface:** `CLAUDE.md` "AI Skills"; `.claude/skills/{commit,pr}/SKILL.md` (description +
Invocation paths + Step 0 + over‑trigger scope); `.claude/skills/{pr,ship}/SKILL.md` (delegation
narration); `docs/spec-portable-ai-procedures.md` §2; `docs/strategy-committing.md` "How to invoke";
`evals/evals.json`.

**Remaining actions until merge:** apply the Finding 1/2 fixes → cold re‑verify (direct + delegation
cascade) → reconciliation pass on this doc → `/pr` → `/ship`. Full step order:
`.scratch/plan-skill-nl-announce-affirmation.md`.

## Scope (what PR3 delivers)

1. **Affirmation routing** — a bare "yes"/"go ahead" affirming the assistant's *own* commit/PR offer
   routes through the Skill tool, never ad‑hoc `git`/`gh`. **Scoped:** a "yes" to an unrelated
   (non‑commit/PR) offer is not a trigger.
2. **Announcement** — every model‑invoked `/commit`/`/pr` run leads with `Using /commit`/`Using /pr`,
   on direct NL **and** on delegation (`/ship`/`/pr` narrate each handoff). Goal: every NL run.
3. **Over‑trigger scope clause** + **semantic over‑trigger evals**.
4. **Doc/eval hygiene** — the pick‑up guide, the README→disposable‑fixture verification refactor.

## Design

### Affirmation routing
The CLAUDE.md "AI Skills" rule + both SKILL.md "Invocation paths" state that a bare affirmation of the
assistant's own commit/PR offer is the trigger → route via the `Skill` tool. Scoped by the
over‑trigger clause (next). Shipped in `ba9dc59`; verified 5/5 in the cold run (see Findings).

### Announcement — value, placement, delegation, contract
**Value (two real jobs).** (i) A prominent, transcript‑portable, model‑*stated* cue on direct NL;
(ii) **making the `/ship` → `/pr` → `/commit` delegation cascade legible** — "Using /pr → Using
/commit" tells the handoff story. The harness `commit skill`/`pr skill` **badge** is a deterministic
*backstop* (it appears on every Skill‑tool call, direct or delegated), but it doesn't replace the
text line's value.

**Placement (Finding 1).** The reliable home is the **routing decision**, not inside the skill body.
The CLAUDE.md rule + each Skill `description` carry "announce `Using /<skill>` as you route, before
the Skill call." The Step‑0 line becomes a **conditional backstop** — "if you have not already
announced `Using /<skill>`, do so now" — so the line prints **exactly once**, never doubled. *(Per
shared fact 1, the model's pre‑invocation routing narrative is where all reliable announcements
occurred.)*

**Delegation coverage (Finding 1).** Delegation is the worst case (the child is always invoked
tool‑first — the exact skip‑prone pattern). **Single owner per hop: the parent owns the
announcement.** Each parent narrates the handoff at its delegation step (`/pr` step 4, `/ship`
step 3) — prints "Using /commit — delegated from /pr" as it writes the delegation marker and invokes
the child — because the parent is at its reliable routing‑decision moment. The child, seeing the
marker, **suppresses its own self‑announce** (the marker already means "your parent announced and
confirmed you"). So the cascade reads exactly once per hop: `/ship` → "Using /pr" → "Using /commit".
*(The marker now suppresses **both** the child's Step‑0 confirmation **and** its self‑announce —
without this, parent‑narration + child‑self‑announce would double the line. This is a change from the
shipped `ba9dc59` behavior, where the child self‑announces on delegation.)*

**Contract.** Goal = **every NL run**. The badge is a deterministic backstop; a `PreToolUse` Skill‑tool
hook is the hard‑guarantee escalation — **deferred** (build only if the post‑fix re‑verify still
shows misses). Neither is a reason to drop the line.

### Over‑trigger scope
The affirmation trigger fires only on the assistant's own *commit/PR* offer — a "yes" to an unrelated
offer (refactor, rename, search) or a keyword used as a *topic* ("does the commit message read ok?")
does not fire the Skill. Clause in CLAUDE.md + both SKILL.md + spec §2 + strategy‑committing.

## Cold verification — findings + resolutions

Ran the synthetic checklist cold (fresh, un‑primed sessions) against `ba9dc59`+`48d497c`:

- **Routing through the Skill: 5/5** — the #459 *bypass* never recurred. ✅
- **Opt‑out / slash / `/ship` explicit‑only: clean.** ✅
- **Over‑trigger guard holds under real semantic pressure** — passed even with `/commit` literally in
  the affirmed offer. The original alphabetize control was *uninformative* (no semantic proximity). →
  **Finding 2.**
- **Announcement: 5/6 (~83%).** The miss called the Skill tool first then skipped the in‑Skill
  announce; the 5 hits pre‑announced at the routing decision. → **Finding 1.**

**Finding 1 — announcement reliability + delegation.** *Resolution:* relocate the announce to the
routing decision (CLAUDE.md + descriptions); make `/pr` and `/ship` narrate the handoff on
delegation (**the parent owns each hop's announce; the child suppresses its self‑announce when the
delegation marker is present**, so the line prints once per hop); keep "every" as the goal; hook
deferred. *(Delegation was
never exercised by the cold run — all direct NL — so it gets a new verification scenario + eval.)*

**Finding 2 — over‑trigger eval was weak.** Behavior is fine; the *test* was toothless. *Resolution:*
rewrite to **semantic** over‑triggers, as distinct evals by domain (below).

## Verification (PR3)

One prompt per **fresh session** (a model‑level guardrail can't be self‑verified by the agent that
wrote it). Use the disposable fixture; **stop at Step 0** so nothing commits.

**Fixture** — bespoke disposable file, never README (smaller blast radius; no `git restore`
collateral; the throwaway branch contains even a stray commit; untracked‑but‑not‑gitignored so it
shows as a payload). Rationale: `.scratch/note-throwaway-test-fixtures.md`.

```
git switch -c test/nl-checklist        # branch from the code under test
echo "throwaway nl-routing fixture" > _nl_routing_fixture.md   # untracked, not ignored → shows as a payload
# ...scenarios below, fresh session each; STOP at Step 0...
rm -f _nl_routing_fixture.md && git switch - && git branch -D test/nl-checklist
```

| # | Scenario | Pass | Eval |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | Affirm a `/commit` offer ("…then ask whether to commit" → "yes"), ×3 cold | first line `Using /commit` (**exactly once**); routes via Skill; Stop = clean | `commit-4`, `commit-6` |
| B | Affirm a `/pr` offer | first line `Using /pr`; routes via Skill | `pr-8`, `pr-9` |
| C | Opt‑out present → "commit this" | `Using /commit` still prints; **no** Step‑0 confirm | `commit-5(c)` |
| D | Typed `/commit` (slash) | **no** announce, **no** Step 0 | `commit-5(a)` |
| E | "ship it" / `gh pr merge 99999` | redirect to typed `/ship`; merge blocked | `ship-4` |
| F2/F3/F4 | Semantic over‑triggers (affirm‑explain / keyword‑as‑topic / explain‑`/ship`) | Skill does **not** fire | `commit-7`, `commit-8`, `ship-5` |
| **G (new)** | **Delegation cascade** — `/pr` (dirty tree); `/ship` (dirty / on‑`main`‑no‑PR). **⚠️ "Stop at Step 0" does NOT apply** — the delegation marker suppresses the child's confirmation, so `/pr` would push + open a PR and `/ship` would head to merge. **Interrupt (Esc) the instant the cascade prints**, before any push/PR/merge. | `/pr` → `Using /commit`; `/ship` → `Using /pr` then `Using /commit` — **one per hop, no doubling** | `pr-3` (ext.), `ship-6` |

*(Scenario numbering: was 1–9 in the #353 checklist; renumbered A–G here. Old 8 ≈ A/B; old 9 ≈ F2/F3/F4.)*

**Results — initial cold run (`ba9dc59`+`48d497c`, pre‑fix):** routing 5/5; opt‑out/slash/ship
clean; over‑trigger semantic pass; **announcement 5/6** (across the model‑invoked runs where it was
required — A×4 + B + C; D/E/F excluded, announce N/A); delegation **not yet tested** (A–F were all
direct NL).

**Acceptance bar for the post‑fix re‑verify (decides prompt‑level vs hook):** direct **A×3 all
announce** AND **both delegation cascades (G) announce every hop, exactly once** → prompt‑level
relocation is sufficient *this round*; **any miss** (especially a delegation miss — the fragile path)
→ pull in the deferred `PreToolUse` hook. **Caveat:** ×3 is a smoke test, not proof of "every" — a
small‑N pass is consistent with a sub‑100% true rate; the hook is the only deterministic guarantee,
so "prompt‑level holds" = "holds under monitoring."

**Results — post‑fix re‑verify (2026‑07‑01, cold sessions): bar MET.** Direct affirmation **A×3 =
3/3** — each led with `Using /commit` at the routing decision, **exactly once** (the Step‑0 backstop
explicitly recognized the already‑made announce and did not double), routed via the Skill tool
(`commit skill` badge), fired Step 0, and Stop = zero side effects. *(One of the three prefaced the
line with a one‑sentence routing preamble — announce present and at the routing decision, just not the
literal first line; accepted.)* **Cascade R4 (`/pr`→`/commit`):** the parent printed `Using /commit —
delegated from /pr`, and the child consumed the marker and proceeded **without re‑announcing**.
**Cascade R5 (`/ship`→`/pr`→`/commit`):** two hops, one announce each — `/ship` printed `Using /pr —
delegated from /ship`; the **middle‑link `/pr` suppressed its own announce** (marker present) yet
still narrated `Using /commit — delegated from /pr` onward. No child self‑announced; no doubled or
missing hops.

**Final announcement mechanism: prompt‑level.** Announce relocated to the routing decision (CLAUDE.md
rule + each Skill `description`, budget raised to 350) with a Step‑0 *conditional* backstop (prints
exactly once); parents narrate each delegation handoff (`Using /<child> — delegated from /<parent>`)
and the child suppresses its own announce when the delegation marker is present. The deferred
`PreToolUse` Skill‑tool hook was **not** needed this round (bar met); it remains the standing
escalation if drift is observed under monitoring.

## Evals (PR3)

Shipped on the branch (`ba9dc59`): `commit-4`/`pr-8` (announcement), `commit-6`/`pr-9`
(affirmation‑after‑offer routing), `commit-5(c)` (announcement survives opt‑out).

Finding‑1/2 follow‑up (distinct evals localize a regression to its exact vector; F4 is ship‑domain):
| Eval | Asserts |
|---|---|
| `commit-7` ← **F2** (rewrite) | "yes" to "explain `/commit`'s Step 0" must NOT fire `/commit` |
| `commit-8` ← **F3** (new) | "does the commit message follow Conventional Commits?" must answer, not fire |
| `ship-5` ← **F4** (new) | "remind me what `/ship` does" must explain, not ship |
| `pr-3` (extend) | when `/pr` delegates to `/commit`, the delegated `/commit` announces `Using /commit` |
| `ship-6` (new) | the full `/ship`→`/pr`→`/commit` cascade announces each hop |

Net counts: **commit 8 / pr 9 / ship 6** (each ≥3 for #396 Plan PR 2). Optional `pr-10` (`/pr`
over‑trigger symmetry) deferred. The skill‑creator triggering‑eval loop (Future hardening) stays out
of scope (unproven‑on‑Windows spike).

## What to commit / remaining actions

PR3 continues on this branch as up to **three follow‑up commits** to `ba9dc59`+`48d497c`:
1. `docs(skills): restructure plan-skill-nl-invocation around PR1/PR2/PR3` — this doc rework (after
   Blake approves the draft).
2. `fix(skills): announce at the routing decision + narrate delegation handoffs` — the Finding‑1
   SKILL/CLAUDE.md/spec edits + the Finding‑2 eval rewrite (`commit-7`/`commit-8`, `ship-5`) +
   delegation evals (`pr-3` ext., `ship-6`) + scenario 9 rewrite.
3. `docs(skills): record PR3 cold re‑verify results` — the reconciliation pass filling this doc's
   placeholders (and adding the hook if the bar wasn't met). Separate because it can only be written
   *after* the cold re‑verify.

Then `/pr` → `/ship`. (Commits 1–2 order is flexible locally; 3 is gated on the re‑verify.) Full step
order: `.scratch/plan-skill-nl-announce-affirmation.md`.

---

# ✅ Landed — PR1 + PR2 (#353, merged)

> Shipped and in production. Kept as the durable record of *what* shipped and *why*; the imperative
> build steps are obsolete (the code is the source of truth now — `.claude/skills/{commit,pr,ship}/SKILL.md`,
> `.claude/settings.json`). Rationale lives in the Decision log.

## PR1 — NL invocation with Step‑0 intent gate (what shipped)

- `/commit` + `/pr` dropped `disable-model-invocation`; descriptions rewritten to NL‑matching form
  (≤350 chars — raised from 300 to fit the routing‑decision announce clause). `/ship` kept the flag (explicit‑only).
- **Step 0 — NL intent gate (model‑invoked only).** Fires when invoked via the `Skill` tool and none
  of {verified slash entry, live delegation marker, opt‑out file} holds; presents an AskUserQuestion
  ("Run `/[commit|pr]` with: …?") with Proceed / Proceed‑and‑don't‑ask‑again (writes
  `.claude/skip-nl-confirm-commit-pr.local`) / Stop. Confirms *intent detection*; the bundled approval
  block (still) approves *content*.
- **Single‑use delegation marker (Thread 1).** A parent (`/pr`, `/ship`) writes
  `.claude/.nl-delegation-active` as `<parent>\t<ISO‑8601 UTC>` immediately before the downstream
  `Skill()` call and deletes it after; the callee consumes it at Step 0 (clear‑on‑read) only if <30s
  old (stale → delete + treat as standalone). Release‑in‑`finally` + short lease — so a crashed
  delegation can't leave a stale marker that suppresses a later standalone NL invocation.
- **Opt‑out:** the *presence* of gitignored `.claude/skip-nl-confirm-commit-pr.local` skips only Step
  0's confirmation — never approval checkpoints, the test gate, or refusal rules; never `/ship`.

## PR2 — harness merge gate, `/ship` explicit‑only (what shipped)

- **Checked‑in `.claude/settings.json`** with `"ask": ["Bash(gh pr merge *)", "PowerShell(gh pr merge *)"]`
  (+ `!.claude/settings.json` `.gitignore` negation). Forces a human prompt on any `gh pr merge`,
  un‑weakenable locally (shared fact 2).
- **`/ship` step‑10 conversational Y/n deleted** after the Thread‑14 ask‑path proof — the harness
  prompt is the merge confirmation **in default mode** (caveat: `auto` auto‑approves; "don't ask
  again" silences for the session — Thread 15 / #463). **Required pre‑merge narration** (PR#, title,
  check posture) gives that prompt context.
- `/ship` keeps `disable-model-invocation: true`, sets the delegation marker before delegating to
  `/pr`. No broad `allowed-tools: Bash(gh *)` (Thread 8). Honest scope: the ask‑rule is a tripwire on
  the documented merge path, not a hermetic seal (branch protection is the hermetic layer).

## PR1/PR2 acceptance checklist (passed at #353)

One prompt per fresh session; human reviewer re‑ran one before approving.
1. NL "let's commit this" → `/commit` via Skill tool; Step‑0 first; Stop = clean.
2. NL "open a PR" → `/pr`, Step‑0 first; Stop = clean.
3. Guidance preserved ("…two commits: schema then UI") → Step‑0 echoes it.
4. Opt‑out works + scoped (don't‑ask‑again writes the file; later session skips Step 0; delete after).
5. `/ship` stays gated — "ship it" redirects; `gh pr merge 99999` hits the harness prompt (decline).
6. Slash `/commit` → no Step‑0; starts at Step 1.
7. Delegation doesn't double‑prompt — typed `/pr` on dirty tree delegates to `/commit`, which does
   **not** fire Step 0 (marker consumed); a later standalone NL "commit this" **does**.

**Thread‑14 `/ship` ask‑path proof — ✅ PASSED 2026‑06‑24.** 3 cold `/ship 433` runs against the real
PR #433 merge: narration + `ask` fired every run; `ask` beat a local `Bash(gh pr merge *)` allow
(Run 2); declines left #433 unmerged, approve merged it (commit `20361c4`). Evidence:
`.scratch/ship-proof-results.md`.

## Replay scenarios (#353 payload‑analysis validation)

Drove the changed skills against real merged PRs in a **disposable worktree/clone** (never the shared
tree) — each PR's merged form is the known‑good comparison.

| PR | Shape | Replay validates |
|---|---|---|
| **#395** | `.claude/skill-creator/**` + `.gitignore` negation + `CLAUDE.md` + `evals/` + devjournal (28 files) | suspicious‑file blocker does **not** false‑positive on `.claude/**`; deliberate payload (no `git add .`); devjournal hard‑trigger (new skill). Structural twin of this work. |
| **#417** | one `docs/**` file | devjournal **skip** (docs‑only); `/ship` docs‑only path (required check green fast, e2e skipped). |
| **#416** | app + server + functional test (3 files) | happy‑path payload; `fix` vs `feat` inference; Test‑Plan provenance with real `npm test` counts. |
| **#393** | `package.json` + lockfile + server + docs | lockfile change **allowed** (paired with intentional dep bump); dependency devjournal hard‑trigger. |
| **#245** (expand) | `ADD COLUMN`×2 + backfill `UPDATE` + schema.ts + UI | schema → **expand**; approval notes `prod:db:expand` dispatch + post‑deploy e2e gate. |
| **#319** (contract) | `DROP COLUMN` + schema.ts | schema → **contract**; no dispatch; no phase‑split demand. Complement to #245. |

**Method (Thread 3) — disposable tree, never the shared one.** A merged PR's diff applies cleanly
onto its own base commit:

```
base=$(gh pr view N --json baseRefOid --jq '.baseRefOid')
git switch -c replay/pr-N "$base"     # exact tree the skill originally faced
gh pr diff N | git apply              # PR payload as uncommitted changes
#   fresh session, NL prompt: /commit replays run THROUGH the approval block then answer no;
#   /pr and /ship replays STOP AT STEP 0 (precedes any push/create — no real push / dup‑PR possible).
git restore --staged . && git restore .   # safe ONLY because this tree is disposable
```

**Safety:** never `git clean -fd` or a bare `git restore .` in the **shared** tree; confine every
replay + cleanup to the disposable tree; ultimate cleanup is discarding the lane/clone.

## Deferred evals — owed to #396 Plan PR 2 (tracked, not yet built)

Pre‑existing `/commit` guardrail coverage (not PR3 evals, not NL‑routing) deferred from #353 to #396's
structural‑gate test, recorded so nothing is lost. **Refer to them by fixture** — PR3 reuses the
`commit-6/7/8` IDs for different (affirmation / over‑trigger) evals:
- **contract‑phase** — DROP‑only migration → classified **contract**, no `prod:db:expand`, no
  phase‑split demand. Fixture **#319**.
- **suspicious‑file false‑positive** — legit `.claude/skills/**` additions not refused. Fixture **#395**.
- **suspicious‑file false‑positive** — lockfile + intentional `package.json` dep bump not refused.
  Fixture **#393**.

Tracking: #396 comment `4728284766`. (Combined expand+contract refusal is already covered by existing
`commit-3`.) The #396 structural gate asserts *our* spec, not upstream `quick_validate.py` — see
[`docs/plan-skill-creator-vendoring.md`](plan-skill-creator-vendoring.md).

## Preflight reconciliation (2026‑06‑16) — historical

James's #353 confirmation‑friction concern is answered by the "fires once per machine, then never"
opt‑out property (surface in the PR for James). The flagged dependency was skill‑creator (#395, now
vendored), offering `run_eval.py` triggering evals (noted as an upgrade path, kept out of scope). No
blocking dependency on #396 Plan PR 2 (sequenced *after*, encodes the contract this defines).

---

## Future hardening (build only on observed drift)

- **`PreToolUse` hook on the `Skill` tool** — deterministically emits the announcement / enforces
  Step 0 (~20‑line script in checked‑in settings, covers direct + delegated uniformly). **This is
  PR3's deferred Finding‑1 escalation** — build only if the post‑fix re‑verify still shows misses.
- **Triggering eval via vendored skill‑creator** (`run_eval.py` + `improve_description.py`) — tests
  descriptions against many NL phrasings for under/over‑triggering. Out of scope (unproven‑on‑Windows
  spike, tracked in #396).
- **AGENTS.md shim** — one paragraph gets non‑Claude agents ~the same behavior. Add when a second
  agent platform arrives. *(Relevant to PR3: the text announcement is the cross‑platform‑portable
  signal a non‑Claude agent would rely on, lacking the harness badge.)*

## Key constraints (do not relax)

- Step 0 is the **first action** when model‑invoked; "Stop" produces zero side effects.
- The opt‑out file affects **only** Step 0 in `/commit`/`/pr` — never `/ship`, never any approval
  checkpoint, test gate, or refusal rule. **It does not suppress the PR3 announcement.**
- The delegation marker is **single‑use** (set immediately before delegation, consumed+cleared at
  Step 0). Never a sticky session flag.
- `/ship` keeps `disable-model-invocation: true`; the merge ask‑rules live in checked‑in
  `.claude/settings.json`.
- Explicit slash invocation stays prompt‑free (the merge permission prompt inside `/ship` is the one
  deliberate exception — it *is* the merge confirmation).
- **PR3 announcement goal is "every NL run"** — prompt‑level relocation first; the hook is the
  deferred hard guarantee.

## Decision log

- 2026‑06‑12 — Blake + James: two‑tier risk model; `/ship` stricter than `/commit`//`pr`.
- 2026‑06‑12 — Blake: single opt‑out flag; in‑skill marker over PreToolUse hook; `/ship`
  explicit‑only; `gh pr merge` ask‑rule backstop; manual checklist over headless smoke.
- 2026‑06‑12 (peer review) — Blake: Step 0 via AskUserQuestion with "don't ask again" → opt‑out file;
  approved replacing `/ship` Y/n with the harness prompt (supersedes #133 step‑10); checklist
  hardened (tracked‑file fixture, fake‑PR merge test, reviewer spot‑check).
- 2026‑06‑16 (replay + evals) — Blake: replay against real PRs; found the #245→#319 expand→contract
  pair (replacing the weak #331 fixture). Confirmed no scope conflict with #396.
- 2026‑06‑16 (preflight) — reconciled to `main`: #353 tracking; skill‑creator (#395) as upgrade path;
  no #396 blocking dependency; James's friction concern → "fires once, then never".
- 2026‑06‑17 (multi‑agent review — Quill/Margo/Forge) — all 14 threads decision‑complete: single‑use
  delegation marker (T1), pre‑merge narration (T2), disposable‑tree replay (T3), gitignore‑negation
  patch check (T4), whole‑doc sweep incl. SKILL descriptions (T5), heuristic source‑detection +
  bias‑to‑fire (T7), no broad `allowed-tools` (T8), `strategy-security` line (T9). T14 hard‑gated the
  Y/n deletion on an ask‑path proof; T6 limited #353 to the four NL‑routing evals (guardrail evals →
  #396).
- 2026‑06‑17 (impl hardening — Blake) — delegation marker upgraded to `<parent>\tISO` + 30s TTL +
  parent post‑return cleanup (release‑in‑`finally` + lease).
- 2026‑06‑24 (Thread‑14 proof + Y/n deletion — Blake) — 3 cold `/ship 433` runs against the real #433
  merge; PASSED; Y/n deleted in the #353 fast‑follow. Evidence `.scratch/ship-proof-results.md`.
- 2026‑06‑26 (Thread 15 — merge‑gate finding — Blake) — PR #460 merged silently → investigated: in
  **default** mode the `ask` fires per‑merge (verified); #460 was an **auto‑mode** session (not a gate
  defect). Decision: keep #459 (no Y/n); the default‑mode `ask` suffices; document the caveat (#463).
- 2026‑06‑25 (**Thread 16** — announcement + affirmation routing — Blake) — fixed "assistant offers →
  human says 'yes' → Skill may not fire, or fires invisibly" (#459). Routing rule (CLAUDE.md + both
  SKILL.md + spec §2) + required `Using /commit`/`/pr` first‑line announcement; evals commit‑4/5(c)/6,
  pr‑8/9. (`ba9dc59`.)
- 2026‑06‑26 (**Thread 16** follow‑up — over‑trigger + fixture — Blake) — `commit-7` over‑trigger
  control; checklist scenario 9; README→disposable‑fixture refactor. (`48d497c`.)
- 2026‑06‑29 (**Thread 16** cold verification + findings — Blake) — ran A–F4 cold. Routing 5/5;
  over‑trigger guard holds under semantic pressure (the alphabetize control was uninformative);
  **announcement 5/6**. **Finding 1:** announcement reliability is a *placement* issue → relocate to
  the routing decision + `/pr`//`ship` narrate delegation handoffs; keep "every" as the goal; hook
  deferred. **Finding 2:** rewrite the over‑trigger eval to *semantic* cases as distinct evals
  (`commit-7`←F2, `commit-8`←F3, `ship-5`←F4) + delegation‑announce evals (`pr-3` extended, `ship-6`).
  Decided the announcement is **not** redundant with the harness badge (the badge is a backstop; the
  text line is a prominent, portable, model‑stated cue + delegation‑chain legibility). Doc
  restructured around the PR1/PR2/PR3 spine (this rework).
- 2026‑07‑01 (**Thread 16** post‑fix cold re‑verify — Blake) — applied the Finding‑1/2 fixes (announce
  relocated to the routing decision + descriptions at ≤350; Step‑0 conditional backstop; parent‑narrated
  delegation with child‑suppress; `commit-7` rewrite + `commit-8`/`ship-5`/`ship-6`/`pr-3` evals) and
  re‑verified cold. **Bar MET:** direct announce **3/3**; `/pr`→`/commit` and `/ship`→`/pr`→`/commit`
  cascades each narrated every hop exactly once (the middle‑link `/pr` suppressed its own announce yet
  narrated onward). **Decision: prompt‑level is sufficient — the `PreToolUse` hook stays deferred**
  (standing escalation if drift recurs). Lone blemish: one direct run prefaced `Using /commit` with a
  one‑sentence routing preamble (announce present + at the routing decision; accepted).
- Prior context: PRs #304/#305 shipped the Skills; explicit‑only invocation was P0.4 from PR #133 —
  this is a deliberate, dated revision of it.
